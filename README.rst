smartmob-agent - remote process runner
======================================

Description
-----------

This project is a network agent designed to remotely run applications that
follow the `The Twelve-Factor App`_.  All that is required of applications is
that they can be uploaded to the agent over the network and that they contain a
Procfile_ which can be used to start the application's processes.
